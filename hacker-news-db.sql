[1]<p>And FWIW, I don&#x27;t really see why it wouldn&#x27;t do a good job within a guitar amp.

I mean mathematicians are supposed to enjoy challenges &#x2F; difficulties, but Siegel zeros are just so recurrently irritating. The possibility of Siegel zeros means that in so many theorems you want to write down, you have to write caveats like &quot;unless a Siegel zero exists,&quot; or split into two cases based on if Siegel zeros exist or don&#x27;t exist, etc.<p>But here is the worst (or &quot;most mysterious,&quot; depending on your mood..) thing about Siegel zeros. Our best result about Siegel zeros (excluding for present discussion Zhang&#x27;s work), namely Siegel&#x27;s theorem, is ineffective. That is, it says &quot;there exists some constant C &gt; 0 such that...&quot; but it can tell you nothing about that constant beyond that it is positive and finite (we say that the constant is &quot;not effectively computable from the proof&quot;).*<p>So then, if you try to use Siegel&#x27;s theorem to prove things about primes, this ineffectivity trickles down (think &quot;fruit of the poisoned tree&quot;). For example, standard texts on analytic number theory include a proof of the following theorem: any sufficiently large odd integer is the sum of three primes. <i>However</i>, the proof in most standard texts fundamentally <i>cannot</i> tell you what the threshold for &quot;sufficiently large&quot; is, because the proof uses Siegel&#x27;s theorem! In this particular case, it turns out that one can avoid Siegel&#x27;s theorem, and in fact the statement &quot;Any odd integer larger than <i>five</i> is the sum of three primes&quot; is now known <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goldbach%27s_weak_conjecture" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Goldbach%27s_weak_conjecture</a>. But it is certainly not always possible to avoid Siegel&#x27;s theorem, and Zhang&#x27;s result would make so many theorems which right now involve ineffectively computable constants effective.<p>*Why is the constant not effectively computable? Because the proof proceeds basically like this. First: assume the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Then the result is trivial, Siegel zeros are exceptions to GRH and don&#x27;t occur if GRH is true. Next, assume GRH is false. Take a &quot;minimal&quot; counterexample to GRH, and use it to &quot;repel&quot; or &quot;exclude&quot; other possible counterexamples.', 3, 33512338, '[33513590]', NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, '1667860063', '2022-11-08 11:46:51', '2022-11-08 11:46:51'),

The class number formula connects the values of Dirichlet L-functions at s = 1  (Dirichlet L-functions are complex functions related to the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions), to class numbers of number fields. (Remember that the value of Dirichlet L-functions at 1 is exactly what the question of Siegel zeros concerns.)<p>To give a crash course on what some of those words mean:<p>1. A number field is what you get when you take the rational numbers, and you throw in the roots of some polynomials to get a bigger object where you can still do all of the usual arithmetic operations, in the same way that we throw in the roots of x^2 + 1 (namely, i, -i) into the real numbers to get the complex numbers.<p>2. The ring of integers is the right notion of the &quot;integers&quot; in that number field. (That is, rational numbers : integers = number field : ring of integers in that number field.)<p>3. The class number of a number field tells you how close you are to having unique factorization into primes holding in the ring of integers of that number field*. If the class number is 1, then you have unique factorization; if the class number is 1000, then you are very far from it.<p>What this connections means is that you can prove things about regular old primes in arithmetic progressions (in the integers) by proving things about these exotic &#x2F; abstract primes (in rings of integers of number fields), and vice-versa.<p>Anyway, as a result of the class number formula, there are a lot of results about class numbers that are ineffective because of Siegel&#x27;s theorem too, e.g., <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brauer%E2%80%93Siegel_theorem" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Brauer%E2%80%93Siegel_theorem</a>. Zhang&#x27;s result (if correct) would make all of those effective, too.<p>*While in the integers, it is true that every number factors uniquely into a product of primes, this is unfortunately not true in more general contexts. In fact, algebraic number theory basically began with a mistaken proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem, which was mistaken precisely because it assumed that unique factorization always holds in this more general context, which is not true.

All USPTO examiners have classification as one of their duties now, but they are given very little time for this. The time varies between 0 time, 30 minutes, and 1 hour depending on the results of an approval process.<p>Longer version: The USPTO recently made some significant changes to classification and docketing. Applications are docketed to examiners based on a combination of the CPC and USPC classification now, with the eventual goal of eliminating the USPC component of the docketing system. Here&#x27;s how it works: Poorly paid contractors classify patent applications. Based on the classification from the contractors, applications are docketed to examiners. Examiners then have the opportunity to correct the classification if it&#x27;s wrong. As it turns out, poorly paid contractors don&#x27;t classify well. I&#x27;d guess that about 10% of the applications I&#x27;m docketed have serious classification issues. The precise number probably varies appreciably between examiners. I will try to correct the classification issues with a process called a C* challenge. This requires approval by examiners called SCEs. The SCEs will check if they agree with the examiner&#x27;s proposed classification. Sometimes they&#x27;ll add their own classification, but usually not. The amount of time an examiner gets is zero if none of the changes are approved, 30 minutes if the changes are approved but the changes do not cause the application to be transferred from the examiner, and 1 hour if the changes are approved and the changes cause the application to be transferred. Unfortunately, properly classifying applications frequently takes far longer than 1 hour. This is particularly true when examiners have to classify applications in areas they know little about.<p>I don&#x27;t bother changing the classification at this point if it seems mostly right because the amount of time I get for correcting the classification is so small. I will only try to correct the classification if it&#x27;s egregiously wrong.<p>6.

Not the idea itself.<p>Let&#x27;s use Amazon&#x27;s One Click patent as an example:  How many different ways do you think that could be coded&#x2F;handled?

Repeat after me: <i>PATENTS ONLY COVER SPECIFIC IMPLEMENTATIONS OF IDEAS</i>, not the ideas themselves.  Which is exactly what every single software patent that exists defines: Nothing more than a broad concept.<p>You <i>could</i> require that patents provide the actual code that makes them work but <i>then they&#x27;d be worthless</i> because any given bit of code can be implemented an infinite number of ways.

The abstruse economic theories served as a type of schelling point for a coalition of minorites against the Russian Orthodox majority, and after the revolution there was a systematic effort to suppress Russian identity and replace it with a new &quot;Soviet&quot; identity -- e.g. if you look at the list of Soviet general secretaries, only one of them was Russian (although there is some debate as several of the secretaties had mysterious, and in some cases, clearly invented pasts). There were explicit anti-Russian policies put in place, for example there were communist parties in all the provinces except the Russian province, which had no communist party, and thus no road for advancement except to join the overall Soviet Communist Party, but that preferenced non-Russians for membership.<p>Similarly when the Soviets drew the borders of various provinces, they explicitly made the minority provinces much larger, dragging in traditional Russian lands, even as they created local minority communist parties that barred Russians from participation, effectively meaning that 1&#x2F;3 of Russians were living in an explicitly non-Russian province, even though often times they were the majority population in that province.<p>A good book that covers this topic in depth is Terry Martin&#x27;s &quot;Affirmative Action Empire&quot; - <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Affirmative-Action-Empire-Nationalism-1923-1939-ebook&#x2F;dp&#x2F;B01N291P0U" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.amazon.com&#x2F;Affirmative-Action-Empire-Nationalism...</a><p>At the same time, Marxism in other areas had a decidedly nationalist tone - for example in Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam or other nations fighting colonialism.

And not relevant for this, but also Tradfri controllable power outlets.<p>I&#x27;m using a Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 dongle (available on ebay for $20, uses a TI Zigbee chip) plugged into a small single board computer server. Zigbee2MQTT is FOSS software which interfaces with the Zigbee dongle and manages the Zigbee network. You can pair devices to the network with with its web GUI. Zigbee2MQTT allows you to control the devices over MQTT, a lightweight messaging protocol. I wrote a Python script for this. It connects to MQTT and listens for messages from the buttons (on, off, brightness up&#x2F;down, CCT up&#x2F;down). When it gets a message from a button or motion sensor, the script sends a MQTT command to the relevant bulb &#x2F; group of bulbs.<p>My setup is all Ikea Tradfri, but I could very easily add in Hue bulbs or other Zigbee devices such as ones from Aqara or Sonoff.

Newton, Gauss, Kelvin, Tesla, Marie Curie, Pierre Curie, etc.<p>There is a massive misreading of the general situation though like the parent comment mentions. I think until before WWII academia was a rich mans profession. I would bet that people who got into academia were those whose parents had the means to support their education and that they could either independently or through patronage carry out research. This is what most people miss about a PhD or a scholar. It was exclusively a rich mans (and in very exceptional cases a woman married to a rich man or a man married to a rich woman) business. A more extreme example Carl Jung’s wife supported her husband’s research even when he was having an affair with another woman. Remember that cabin he built so eloquently described in “Deep Work” with a walk in the woods. It might have been with the wife’s money.<p>Post WWII government funding for research exploded but there were not enough researchers. Universities brought in more and more professors for their government funded programs and government funded student loans. All professors want tenure track. To handle tenure track you need publications. But now we have a problem - the professors aren’t wealthy. They need to apply for patronage (ahem - government grants) and need to write proposals. The problem is “professorship” is an up or out profession. You get 7 years to move up or get out. In time, the government grants have reduced, the number of professors has ticked upwards. You have a complete rat race for scraps. There are some well-funded departments that continue to attract great students. But by and large its the stress of grant writing that will eat at you.<p>So, in the end the profession itself hasn’t changed much. You’re still petitioning the “rich man” for “patronage”. It’s just that now there are many more petitioners. It’s just not worth it.<p>That being said, there needs to be some mechanism to acquire deep advanced skills as you continue along your professional journey. A masters with a thesis mostly works and can get you a considerable way through.

And the longer you stay, the more you question whether you will ever make it.<p>For us, there were few tenure-tracked positions to be had in that year.

I will try to summarize what is at issue (IANAL nor an expert on this case). I&#x27;m going to start by telling ARM&#x27;s side of the story (since they&#x27;re the ones suing).<p>Nuvia got a license from ARM. Part of that license was a requirement that any transfer of Nuvia&#x27;s tech developed under these licenses required ARM approval. Nuvia agreed to this, presumably to get more favorable rates. Qualcomm bought Nuvia to jumpstart their custom-core business. ARM didn&#x27;t consent to the transfer. Therefore, Qualcomm must destroy the Nuvia tech or reach an agreement with ARM.<p>Why would ARM want to do this? Let&#x27;s say you&#x27;re ARM. You&#x27;re the king of mobile, but you have very little presence in the datacenter. Nuvia comes along and says, &quot;we think ARM can conquer the datacenter.&quot; Awesome, you now have a company that will start rolling some sweet datacenter money your way. But what if Nuvia is just a trojan horse? What if they&#x27;re just a smokescreen to create some custom cores and then have one of the companies that licenses your cores switch to only licensing your architecture? That would be terrible for your revenue. That&#x27;s not Nuvia&#x27;s strategy: they genuinely want to do their stated mission. Nuvia and ARM agree that ARM will have veto power over transfer of their IP. Fast forward a few years and it turns out that chip startups are hard and Qualcomm has lots of cash and the potential to bring your dreams to life - and more. Qualcomm&#x27;s lawyers believe they will be able to get around the agreement - they&#x27;ve been able to bead back FRAND patent claims for decades, even against Apple.<p>Why would Nuvia agree to this? Possibly because they had no other choice. If ARM won&#x27;t give you an architecture license without this, you have to agree to it. Or maybe it was a way of getting a lot of cost savings. Or maybe ARM would give you the kind of support and service that would cut years off the development of your custom cores because ARM felt safe knowing that you couldn&#x27;t just sell that on to Qualcomm or MediaTek.<p>Ultimately, this doesn&#x27;t impact Apple because Apple isn&#x27;t buying Nuvia.<p>ARM says, &quot;The licenses safeguarded Arm&#x27;s rights and expectations by prohibiting assignment without Arm&#x27;s consent, regardless of whether a contemplated assignee had its own Arm licenses.&quot;<p>For ARM, the potential issue here is that Qualcomm (one of their largest licensees) stops buying ARM-designed cores because they have their own designs. That is fair insofar as Qualcomm has an architecture license. However, it isn&#x27;t fair if they do that by buying a company that explicitly agreed that their tech wouldn&#x27;t be transferred without ARM&#x27;s consent.<p>Let&#x27;s say that ARM licensed Nuvia and the restriction was explicit: you can never sell your company to Qualcomm. Then they sell the company to Qualcomm. Not allowed, right? In this case, Qualcomm is arguing that Qualcomm has its own architecture license so it should be allowed to use its architecture license with Nuvia&#x27;s designs.<p>ARM&#x27;s complaint: <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regmedia.co.uk&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;pacer_arm_qualcomm.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regmedia.co.uk&#x2F;2022&#x2F;08&#x2F;31&#x2F;pacer_arm_qualcomm.pdf</a><p>Now, I don&#x27;t have access to the Nuvia&#x2F;ARM contract so I can&#x27;t really say if ARM&#x27;s complaint is valid. Did Nuvia&#x27;s license require the destruction of any technology created under such license when the license terminates as ARM alleges?<p>Qualcomm says that the requirement to destroy information only applies to ARM-provided information and not anything developed under the license.<p><a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regmedia.co.uk&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;01&#x2F;pacer_qualcomm_arm_filing.pdf" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;regmedia.co.uk&#x2F;2022&#x2F;11&#x2F;01&#x2F;pacer_qualcomm_arm_filing....</a><p>It&#x27;s really hard to tell without actually having access to the license agreements who is right. Qualcomm&#x27;s filing seems to fall back on the idea that it would be ridiculous to give ARM this kind of power over what Nuvia had created. However, companies seem to make these types of agreements all the time. ARM wanted to give Nuvia an opportunity to succeed, but also wanted to prevent Nuvia from just selling itself to Qualcomm, MediaTek, etc. So it inserted a clause to prevent that without ARM&#x27;s agreement. Nuvia could be an independent company and sell all its chips and become the next big chip designer. If they wanted to be bought by Qualcomm or someone, they could negotiate with ARM for ARM&#x27;s consent.<p>To me, this op-ed reads like Qualcomm propaganda. To me, it sounds like ARM has Qualcomm dead-to-rights and Qualcomm is trying to allege something unrelated to the case: that ARM wants to cease its architecture licenses because it sees that companies will be able to stop paying them for ARM-designed cores. That would certainly be problematic, but many ARM licensees have perpetual architecture licenses (like Apple and presumably Qualcomm as well) so it wouldn&#x27;t actually impact them if ARM pivoted their business model in this way. It&#x27;s also just speculation on ARM&#x27;s future business model.<p>I definitely understand the position of those who would hate ARM in this case. ARM isn&#x27;t an open-source company. They&#x27;re open...to companies paying them royalties. ARM wants to protect their current revenue while also being open enough that they can enter new markets - like the datacenter. That&#x27;s a hard line to balance, but it sounds like they tried to do that with Nuvia: giving them a license on good terms in exchange for a guarantee that they weren&#x27;t just a trojan horse to undercut revenue from Qualcomm, MediaTek, or others.<p>I&#x27;m not trying to argue that&#x27;s good for consumers or the market in general. As a consumer, if we eliminated all existing patents while pinky-swearing &quot;we won&#x27;t do that again&quot; it would mean we&#x27;d continue to get all the future benefits of patents (since inventors would feel safe that their future inventions would get paid back) while not suffering the monopoly of current patents (since once the invention has been made, we no longer need to incentivize that invention). Likewise, if we just eliminated ARM&#x27;s IP, it would be great - as long as we didn&#x27;t make other companies worry that we&#x27;d be eliminating their IP as well. While we&#x27;re eliminating IP, eliminating Qualcomm&#x27;s patents might have some of the biggest impact - Qualcomm literally wants more royalties from a device if it includes a better screen or camera despite using the same LTE&#x2F;5G.<p>I&#x27;d love to actually see the architecture license with Nuvia, but instead I guess I&#x27;ll just read the sniping that Qualcomm and ARM make in their filings.', 3, 33517653, '[33518664,33518965,33518397,33518923]', NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, '1667910060', '2022-11-08 12:14:49', '2022-11-08 12:14:49'),

Qualcomm wants to transfer what was created by Nuvia with that license.<p>Qualcomm argues that it would be unreasonable to allow a company like ARM to control what Nuvia created entirely on its own with the license from ARM and that a reasonable reading of the agreement would mean that Nuvia would need to destroy only the confidential IP ARM provided. I find that argument compelling, but if Nuvia agreed that restriction it becomes a bit less compelling. Imagine an ARM negotiator saying, &quot;We&#x27;ll give you an architecture license for $X, but we&#x27;ll cut that rate by 75% if you agree that you can&#x27;t transfer the stuff you create.&quot; It probably wasn&#x27;t explicit like that (and may not exist at all according to Qualcomm), but one can see how that restriction might occur.<p>It&#x27;s also hard to completely say where confidential ARM IP would end. For example, let&#x27;s say I work at Nuvia and you work at ARM and the agreement between our companies includes a lot of access to ARM engineers. I shoot you an email, &quot;We&#x27;re having problems with X. Can you offer any guidance?&quot; You reply, &quot;Oh yea, this happens a lot. We suggest you do Y.&quot; Wonderful! Then two years later my cores all do Y and I designed a way to make them do Y...but it was based off the confidential help that you&#x2F;ARM provided me. It&#x27;s a fundamental part of the chip based off that help.<p>I designed it, but I designed it based off confidential information covered by the no-transfer agreement. Is my design confidential ARM IP? Your email telling me to &quot;do Y&quot; needs to be destroyed. But then I built lots of stuff that clearly shows &quot;do Y&quot; that can&#x27;t really be un-done without destroying what I built. Let&#x27;s say we destroy all the confidential ARM information that Nuvia got. Now Qualcomm engineers are learning &quot;do Y&quot; from me and my design rather than from ARM - but I only learned it from ARM.

Digitizing as you suggest doesn&#x27;t really gain anything over paper (except perhaps reporting provisional results faster, but you&#x27;d still need to do a risk-limiting audit to verify that your digital votes didn&#x27;t get hacked so this might be a wash), but it does add more attack surfaces along the chain of custody.<p>Ultimately, paper is a very robust solution to the problem of making the system hard to subvert at scale; you can think of it as a sort of &quot;proof of work&quot;, where it would be extremely difficult for, say, Russia, or the DNC &#x2F; RNC to tamper with large quantities of ballots across the nation.

They really want to grow the marketshare, they have the right price points, and people seem to genuinely like and want them around.

Bigger animals have larger cells, so the number of cells does not scale linearly with the mass of the animal.<p>2. Cells from larger animals are more resistant to cancer development in various ways (eg more copies of TP53, more propensity to die after DNA damage).<p>3. Large animals have non-linear metabolic scaling. So a cell in an elephant sees fewer metabolic cycles per unit time than a cell in a mouse. Some of this is due to the greater thermal efficiency of large animals.<p>Now that we have more detailed data on animals, I think this paradox is a bit less interesting, albeit generally true. For example, there are some animals that just don&#x27;t seem to get cancer (eg the blackbuck and the Patagonian mara, from several hundred autopsies each) [1]. Cancer is also very rare in Zebras. This is fundamentally interesting because it shows that <i>being free from cancer is possible in an otherwise normal looking mammal</i>. In theory therefore, we could consider engineering humans to be cancer free. To me, given the high incidence of cancer, the progressively increasing incidence in an ageing population and the incredible amount of misery it causes, this is the most ethically palatable reason to consider widespread genetic modification of humans. I think all anti-ageing efforts will ultimately bump up against cancer as the limiting factor. The technology to safely genetically engineer humans is nowhere near ready for prime time.<p>The association between height and cancer is not thought to be due to &#x27;more cells&#x27;. It only applies to some types of cancer and not others.

Sell all tickets at $200: Plane only 60% booked, revenue $ 12,000, better but still less than the cost of the flight.<p>Reality: Sell 15 tickets at $400, then sell 60 at $200 and sell 20 at $100.

For each of those blood groups, there is more than one possible configuration of some protein or carbohydrate (something like more than one possible genetic sequence leading to more than one kind of molecule on the surface of the RBCs).<p>And, even with ABO, there can be infrequent variations that make things more complicated (see <a href="https:&#x2F;&#x2F;professionaleducation.blood.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;transfusion&#x2F;best-practices&#x2F;serological-best-practices&#x2F;abo-subgroups" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;professionaleducation.blood.ca&#x2F;en&#x2F;transfusion&#x2F;best-p...</a> for more).<p>For the other blood groups, I think every case the groups were identified because a patient somewhere made an antibody, causing either a transfusion reaction (if not tested ahead of time) or, more likely, a positive (incompatible) reaction on in compatibility testing.<p>Each of those blood groups will have two or more versions.  For example, there is the Kell blood group, which has two primary versions: you can express big K, little k, or both as Kell is a codominant system.  Most people are homozygous little k (kk).  When you are homozygous little k, you can make antibodies to big K (which is expressed on people who are Kk or KK).  So, if you are homozygous little k, you are at risk of making antibodies on exposure to big K.  Of course, not everyone is either big K or little k, that would be too simple.  There are, I think, more than 20 variants of K out there...<p>More or less, each of those blood groups can cause antibody formation if you lack an antigen on the surface of those antibodies.  In practice, the likelihood of an antigen causing antibody formation varies by antigen (the term there is &quot;antigenic&quot;).  Also, the immunologic status of the recipient matters - obviously, someone who is immunosuppressed from an organ transplant may be less likely to form antibodies (that&#x27;s the point of of the immunosuppression). Conversely, some people are more likely than most to form antibodies.<p>Also, it appears that the immune system is more likely to form antibodies in other blood groups if a person already has antibodies. In practice, there is a recommendation from NHLBI to match for C, E, and K in patients who are going to be transfused often to try to avoid forming new antibodies.<p>People &#x27;naturally&#x27; form antibodies to A and to B antigens that they lack (I am group O and have both anti-A and anti-B antibodies).  This is because they are exposed to those antigens in everyday life (the A and B antigen is found on some gut bacteria).  And Rh-D is very immunogenic and clinically significant.<p>When we test blood prior to transfusion, we attempt to identify what antibodies the patient may have.  If they have no unexpected antibodies, just honoring blood and Rh-D type is usually enough.  If they have unexpected antibodies, we go through a complicated process to identify blood that lacks those antibodies to try to avoid a transfusion reaction.<p>(Now to modify that testing point, we know some antibodies are not clinically significant - that is, they do not cause significant transfusion reactions.  So, we can, if we have to, give blood that is incompatible for clinically insignificant antibodies.  We still try to provide blood negative for those antigens because we wouldn&#x27;t find out this patient is the first to have a clinically significant version of the antibody. Also, the blood tests as incompatible with clinically insignificant antibodies, and we would prefer to give blood that tests as compatible).<p>Sorry this is rambling a bit - I have to take my daughter to school.

Being a person who is allowed to donate blood is not related to this cleaning process but statistics about risk and also related to costs. So this is part of why there are no plasma clinics in Canada.<p>The blood donation is tested, but the tests don&#x27;t catch everything. Really horrible diseases can test negative, which is why the process to donate blood includes an interview to categorize a high risk donor. This is why they don&#x27;t let you donate blood when you have been living in europe for many years, have tattoos, multiple sexual partners, or had male-with-male sex. A lot of people hear about this and are totally outraged and jump to assumptions that the blood donation system is stuck in some anti-gay-rights 1900s puritan mindset, but that&#x27;s not what&#x27;s going on.<p>People regularly walk into blood donor clinics, lie about their high risk factors because they want to &quot;prove a point&quot;, the tests for things like HIV can&#x27;t always catch it all the time (especially in early stages; stages where there are no symptoms), and one blood donation could actually make it to several other people (like a baby, a motorcycle accident victim, and a surgery patient). It happens regularly enough that your nation&#x27;s blood supply has a &quot;lookback&#x2F;traceback&quot; program where they have 10-100 people who sit there all day working on cases and sending letters to people who received bad blood, and it can even come up 5+ years later when someone who donated blood in 2015 just got a diagnosis in 2020, all those people in the &quot;bloodline&quot; get notified, banned from the system, and advised to get tested too.<p>Doctors depend on multiple layers of checks to keep the blood supply clean, one of them is a statistical layer, one is a testing layer, one is the processing to keep the blood clean&#x2F;safe, another is policy. Please don&#x27;t interpret my point about plasma being highly cleanable to mean that all blood components in general can be safely received from the homeless.', 3, 33505209, '[33506128]', NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, '1667829866', '2022-11-08 12:32:06', '2022-11-08 12:32:06'),

As you say, one benefit is that calling `next` on an iterator performs a single unit of work getting the next value. This let&#x27;s you avoid e.g. allocating intermediate arrays, let&#x27;s you do infinite streams, etc. Compare that to calling `map` on a list...you have to consume the entire list.<p>- A second benefit of iterators is that of scope. When I call `next` on an iterator I get the next value in the scope of the caller. This is particularly useful in a language with function colouring, because use of the `next` value can match what is required of the caller. E.g. the caller may want to await a function using some field of the `next` value and this is totally fine. Compare that to calling `map` with a lambda and wanting to `await` inside the lambda...the problem is you are now in the wrong scope and can&#x27;t `await`.<p>- So where do generators come in? Well they are just syntactic sugar that will generate the state machine that you would otherwise have to implement by hand in your iterator. In that sense you don&#x27;t need generators at all...<p>- BUT, with generators you can do things that would technically be possible with iterators but would be so clumsy to implement (I&#x27;m thinking here of coroutine libraries) that having them as a distinct feature makes sense.', 3, 33508904, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, '1667853483', '2022-11-08 12:33:41', '2022-11-08 12:33:41'),

Yet human listeners\nexperience it as sequences of discrete speech sounds, which are used to recognise discrete words. To examine how the human brain appropriately\nsequences the speech signal, we recorded two-hour magnetoencephalograms\nfrom 21 participants listening to short narratives. Our analyses show that the\nbrain continuously encodes the three most recently heard speech sounds in\nparallel, and maintains this information long past its dissipation from the\nsensory input. Each speech sound representation evolves over time, jointly\nencoding both its phonetic features and the amount of time elapsed since\nonset. As a result, this dynamic neural pattern encodes both the relative order\nand phonetic content of the speech sequence. These representations are\nactive earlier when phonemes are more predictable, and are sustained longer\nwhen lexical identity is uncertain. Our results show how phonetic sequences in\nnatural speech are represented at the level of populations of neurons, providing insight into what intermediary representations exist between the sensory input and sub-lexical units.

I wonder if they are making the mistake of thinking everyone is referring to the word &quot;sex&quot; in the same way?<p>The author seems to be talking about sex in terms of gametes - i.e. sperm and eggs. They make the claim that there is an absolute sex difference between male and female sexes in terms of this gamete structure. I am happy to take them on their word on this point.<p>But this is obviously not the only definition we have for sex. Individuals in a gonochoric species have a sex that in most cases corresponds to the gametes that they can produce, but this is not absolute. In humans, we know that intersex and possibly even hermaphroditic individuals can exist: these people certainly do not conform to a perfectly binary sex distinction. So clearly there is a definition of sex - and a widely used one at that - where the author is incorrect, and human sexes are more complicated than a perfect binary split.<p>This obviously doesn&#x27;t invalidate the rest of the article, but it does suggest that some of the issue may lie in communication rather than oppression. For example, the author links to the &quot;gender unicorn&quot; model, but this fairly plainly discusses sex as a medical phenomenon (where it is typically assigned at birth, corresponds to reproductive organs, and where some people will not clearly fall in one category or another). This is presumably not being used by the same people studying evolutionary biology, where sex is an expression of gamete-based reproduction and - at least at a population level - binary. (Or at least, if it is, I imagine it will be within a specific context.)<p>Looking through some of the evidence linked by the article, this seems to be the case. For example, the article links statements from scientific groups claiming that sex is a continuum, but the statements are very clearly in response to decisions that would affect medical care for humans (where it would be incorrect to assume a strict distinction - if anything, medicine is the study of exceptions to the norm), and do not in principle disagree with that continuum being bimodal in respects to gamete-based reproduction.<p>Similarly, the author cites another article that they believe restricts discussion on reproduction to species that don&#x27;t have binary sex. But my reading of the same article is (a) that it is exclusively focused on educating students (rather than wider scientific discussion), and (b) arguing for more examples rather than fewer to help students understand that reproduction can be much more complex than the traditional &quot;sexual&#x2F;asexual&quot; model that they are often taught before university.<p>I am not in academia, so ultimately I can&#x27;t tell the author that what they&#x27;re experiencing isn&#x27;t true. But as someone reading their article, I came away with the impression that the author would do well to read through some of the sources they cite with a more open mind, and attempt to understand why some people are concerned about biological gender in humans being restricted to a binary state.', 3, 33515931, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, 0, '1667908001', '2022-11-08 12:36:29', '2022-11-08 12:36:29'),
